****Onion Architecture****
-introduced by Jeffrey Palermo 
-To provide a better way to build applications in perspective of better testability, maintainability, and dependability.
-Onion architecture layers interact to each other by using the Interfaces. 
-C# programmers are drawn to Onion Architecture due to the dependency flows.

*Principle*
-Onion Architecture is based on the inversion of control principle. 
Onion Architecture is comprised of multiple concentric layers interfacing each other towards the core that represents the domain. 
The architecture does not depend on the data layer as in classic multi-tier architectures, but on the actual domain models.

****.NET***

-.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
-With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

**Languages
.NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.
-C# 			-simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
-F#				-programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, robust, and performant code.
-Visual Basican -approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe, object-oriented apps.

**Cross Platform
-Whether you're working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run natively on any compatible operating system. 
-You can build many types of apps with .NET. 
-Some are cross-platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices.

**One consistent API
-.NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs that are common to all .NET applications.
-Each app model can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on, or the capabilities it provides. 
-For example, ASP.NET is the cross-platform web framework that provides additional APIs for building web apps that run on Linux or Windows.

**Libraries
-To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy .NET package ecosystem.
-NuGet is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 100,000 packages.

**Active community and open-source
-.NET is open source and under the .NET Foundation. 
-The .NET Foundation is an independent organization to foster open development and collaboration around the .NET ecosystem.

**Tools
-The Visual Studio product family provides a great .NET development experience on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
-The Visual Studio Marketplace has thousands of editor extensions from Microsoft and others.
-to use a different editor, there are .NET command-line tools and plug-ins for many popular editors.

***.NET Framework****
-.Net Framework is a software development platform 
-Developed by Microsoft for building and running Windows applications.
-It consist of 
				-developer tools
				-programming languages, and 
				-libraries to build desktop and web applications.
-It is also used to build websites, web services, and games.
-first version of the .Net framework---->> .Net framework 1.0 --->>in 2002.
-current version of .Net Framework--->> 4.7.2.
-.Net framework can be used to create both form-based and Web-based applications.
- Web services can also be developed using the .Net framework.
-It also supports various programming languages such as visual basic and c#.

***.Net Framework Architecture***
-It is programming model for the .Net platform
-it provides an execution environment and integration with various programming languages for 
 simple development and deployment of various Windows and desktop applications.
-It consists of class libraries and reusable components.

***.NET Components***

*Languages--->>WinForms
			   ASP.Net
			   ADO.Net

##WinForms
- This is used for developing Forms-based applications, which would run on an end user machine. 
- Notepad is an example of a client-based application.

##ASP.Net
- This is used for developing web-based applications, which are made to run on any browser such as Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox.   
- 		   
			   
*Library--->>Framework class library
*CLR--->>Common language runtime.

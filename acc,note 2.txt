**Object-Oriented Programming 

-its commonly known as OOPs is a technique, not a technology
- its a methodology
-this deals with the internal design of the software, not the external design.
-OOP is faster and easier to execute
-OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
-OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
-OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

 **//Classes and Objects
 -class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
 -When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
 -class, and objects addresses the reusability functionality
 -class is a definition and objects are instances.
 
 **Class:
A class is simply a user-defined data type that represents both state and behavior. 
The state represents the properties and behavior is the action that objects can perform. 
In other words, we can say that a class is the blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object. 
A class is a blueprint from which the individual objects are created. 
In C#, a Class is composed of three things i.e. a name, attributes, and operations.

**Objects:
It is an instance of a class. 
A class is brought live by creating objects. 
An object can be considered as a thing that can perform activities. 
The set of activities that the object performs defines the objectâ€™s behavior. 
All the members of a class can be accessed through the object. 
To access the class members, we need to use the dot (.) operator. 
The dot operator links the name of an object with the name of a member of a class.
